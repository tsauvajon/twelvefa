# Interview with Ori (ori.co) â€” Technical Task

## Summary

[TODO]

## 12 Factors

https://12factor.net/

### I. Codebase
*One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys*

The code is tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/tsauvajon/12fa). All deploys
are made from this single source.

### II. Dependencies
*Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies*

Using [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules), all dependencies
are declared and documented with their version in the `go.mod` file.

### III. Config
*Store config in the environment*

Instead of using configuration files, or even worse, storing the configuration
in the code, environment variables are read when the service is started.

### IV. Backing services
*Treat backing services as attached resources*

[TODO]

### V. Build, release, run
*Strictly separate build and run stages*

This service is first tested and built (using CircleCI), deployed to a container
registry, and finally deployed in the production kubernetes cluster.

### VI. Processes
*Execute the app as one or more stateless processes*

[TODO]

### VII. Port binding
*Export services via port binding*

The application runs on the local port defined by `$PORT` (default: 80). Using
Docker, we bind this port to any port we want. For example, if I want to run this
service locally on port 3000, I'll bind the host port 3000 on the container's
port 80: `docker run -p 3000:80`

### VIII. Concurrency
*Scale out via the process model*

[TODO]

### IX. Disposability
*Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown*

[TODO]

### X. Dev/prod parity
*Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible*

Using Docker and Docker-Compose for local development, and kubernetes for
production, I am able to achieve relative similarity in both environments.

Any other environment that would need to be added (next one would be staging),
would use kubernetes as well.

### XI. Logs
*Treat logs as event streams*

[TODO]

### XII. Admin processes
*Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes*

[TODO]
